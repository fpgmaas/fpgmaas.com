The official Sporthive page with the results for the Rotterdam Marathon 2022
can be found [here](https://results.sporthive.com/events/6914931831426482176/races/481627).

## About

I recently rewrote my personal website from scratch in [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), which in combination with
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) allows for reactive components within a blog post. This blog post is the result of some
experimenting with React components.

The page was built by first scraping the [Sporthive](https://results.sporthive.com/) API with Python, the code for which
can be found in [this github repository](https://github.com/fpgmaas/sporthive-api-scraper). That results in a
[.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fpgmaas/sporthive-api-scraper/main/data/6914931831426482176_481627.json) file
that can be read by this page and turned into reactive components. The source code for this blog post can also be found on
[github](https://github.com/fpgmaas/fpgmaas.com/tree/main/src/posts/2022-4-11-rotterdam-marathon).
