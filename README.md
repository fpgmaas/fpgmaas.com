This repository contains code for my personal website, which can be found at [fpgmaas.com](https://fpgmaas.com).

#### TODO
- Find out how to solve issue with the namespace of json imports; names now have to be unique over all blog posts.
- Make the colors from colors.scss available in .js files, then remove hardcoded colors from plotly.js.
- Find out if it's possible to add pageviews to the blog.
- Add pagination to the blog page.
- Add functionality to allow tagging of posts and search for posts by tag.
